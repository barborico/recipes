## Description

From Plum: "The trick to this recipe is using a mild-flavored, firm, silken tofu and draining it completely. This will give you a sturdy, creamy ricotta that, when cooked, takes on a slightly crumbly texture. If you use a blender instead of a food processor, make the ricotta in two batches so it doesn't get overworked."

This ricotta is good in baking, on pasta, or in salads. It will keep in the fridge for a week. 

## Ingredients

- 1 14-16 oz package firm silken **tofu**
- 1 tsp **dried basil**
- 1/2 tsp chopped **garlic**
- 1 tsp **salt**
- 1 tsp ground **pepper**
- 1/4 cup **olive oil**
- 2 1/2 Tbsp **lemon juice**
- (optional) 2 tsp **evaporated cane juice** or half as much honey
- 2 Tbsp chopped **fresh basil**

## Instructions

1. Drain and press the tofu thoroughly.
2. Add all ingredients but the fresh basil to a food processor and blend until smooth.
3. Add the fresh basil and blend until it is incorporated, but not homogenous.

## Variations

### Crumbly Topping

To get a crumbly topping for salads or pastas, add the ricotta to a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until parts brown and it acquires a drier texture.
