## Description

LÃ©la's go-to dish has been a hit with everyone we've served it to! It's super flavorful, beautiful in the bowl, and fairly well-rounded.

## Ingredients

- cooked **grains** of choice, e.g. brown rice or TJ's Harvest Grains Blend
- **arugula**
- chopped **pistachios** or other nuts
- (optional) poached or scrambled **eggs**

### Mashed Potatoes

- 2 large **sweet potatoes**, cut into chunks
- 2 Tbsp **olive oil**
- 2 tsp **turmeric**
- 2 cloves **garlic**, pressed
- 2 cups **vegetable broth**
- (optional) 1/4-1/2 cup **whole milk** or half-and-half

### Lemon Herb Dressing

- 1/4 cup **lemon juice**
- 1/4 cup **olive oil**
- 1 clove **garlic**, pressed
- 2 teaspoons **sugar** or honey
- 1/2 cup **parsley**
- 1/2 teaspoon **salt**

## Instructions

### Mashed Potatoes

1. Heat the sweet potatoes with olive oil in a skillet over medium high heat.
2. Add the turmeric and toss to coat.
3. Add the garlic and vegetable broth. Simmer until the potatoes are soft and the liquid is almost all absorbed.
4. Transfer to a small bowl and mash. Add the milk, if using it, and season with salt and pepper.

### Dressing

Pulse all ingredients in a blender or food processor and then season to taste.

### Assembling the Bowls

You can assemble the bowls or just let folks do it themselves.

Add a scoop each of grains and mashed potatoes as the base, throw a handful of arugula on top, and finally add an egg (if you're an egg-eater).
Sprinkle with the nuts and then finish with a liberal drizzle of the dressing.
