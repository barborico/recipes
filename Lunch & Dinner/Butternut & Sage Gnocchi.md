## Instructions

*Note:* this is an asynchronous process; some steps will need to start before the prior step has completed. Please read through all before you set forth.

### Pasta

1. Prepare (drain/roast/grind/etc.) the ingredients.
2. Puree all the pasta ingredients minus the flour, e.g. with an immersion blender. Then stir in flour until the dough is capable of being rolled into logs (see next step). The more flour you add here, the chewier and less tender the finished pasta will be, and the better it will hold its shape--so make that trade off.
3. Liberally dust a surface (ideally wood) with flour for rolling, and your hands as well.
4. Make the individual pastas as follows: Take a handful of dough and roll it into a log about the thickness of your thumb (~3/4 inch diameter). Then cut that log into inch-long widths. To get the concave gnocchi shape that captures sauce so well, place your index and middle finger together near the top of the segment, perpendicular to the original length of the log. Applying moderate downward pressure, drag the piece of dough towards you across the countertop; it should curl up around the tips of your fingers. Set aside finished pastas.  
See an example of [how to roll pasta](https://youtu.be/GgaRW1Gjv0Q?t=244).
5. Partway through rolling, fill a large pot with water and begin heating it on the stove. Add a few shakes of salt to the water and cover.
6. When the gnocchi are rolled and the pot is boiling, turn the heat down and carefully add the pasta to the water. Gently stir to avoid them sticking together or to the pot. Let the pasta simmer until they rise to the surface of the water (usually 5-10 minutes?). You can either skim these off incrementally and place them into your serving dish, or wait until most are floating and then pour out and strain the entire batch at once.
7. Immediately add the sauce (or other oil) to prevent pastas from sticking. Serve and enjoy!

### Sauce

1. While the pasta are cooking, heat the oil in a saucepan on the stove on medium. If the oil is unsalted, add a pinch.
2. Add sage and garlic and heat, stirring, until the sage is crisp and the mixture is fragrant and starting to turn brown (usually 3 minutes).
3. Add the black pepper.

## Variations

### Lazy Shapes

If you're pressed for time and don't care too much about the pasta's appearance, you can scoop teaspoonfuls of dough directly into the boiling water for cooking or onto a floured tray for freezing.

### Freezing

These gnocchi can be frozen for long term storage. To do so, place the rolled pastas from step 4 in a single layer on a cookie sheet in the freezer (this keeps them from sticking in clumps). Once they're solid, you can transfer them to a ziplock bag.

When you're ready to cook frozen gnocchi, pick up at step 5. Transfer frozen or partially thawed pasta directly into the boiling water. It's important to have a large ratio of water to gnocchi here so that the water can quickly return to boiling.

### Sauteeing

For a crispier pasta, make the sauce in a large skillet. Then when gnocchi are finished cooking, add them to the skillet and sautee to desired texture.

This is also a delightful way to reheat leftovers!

### Alternative Sauces

Want a different sauce? Here are a few ways to spice things up:
- Add 1/2 tsp paprika and 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes to the sauce described above.
- For dairy-eaters, add grated parmesan or romano.
