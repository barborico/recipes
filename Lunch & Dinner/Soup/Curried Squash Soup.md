# Curried Squash Soup

**Vegan**  
**Servings:** 5-6  
**Time:** 40 minutes

## Description

This recipe was originally designed with butternut squash in mind, but it will turn many types of squash into a delightful peppery soup--perfect for winter! This should always be served hot; heat brings out the spice and truly makes the dish.

## Ingredients

- 6 cups **squash**, skinned and chopped (depending on the squash, you may need to roast/steam first)
- 2 cups **vegetable broth**
- 2 cups **soymilk**
- 3 Tbsp unrefined **coconut oil**
- 2 medium **shallots**, thinly diced
- 2 cloves **garlic**, pressed
- 1-2 Tbsp **maple syrup**
- 1 1/2 Tbsp **curry powder**
- 1/3 tsp **cayenne pepper** or 1 tsp **chili garlic paste**
- 1/3 tsp **cinnamon**
- **salt** and **pepper** to taste
- roasted and salted **pepitas** for garnishing

## Instructions

1. Heat the oil in a pot on medium. When hot, add the shallots and garlic and saute for a couple minutes, stirring often.
2. Add the squash, spices, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Cover and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. Add the soy milk, broth, and maple syrup and bring to a boil. Then reduce the heat and simmer until the squash is soft (about 15 minutes).
4. Use an immersion blender to blend the mixture until it is smooth.
5. Add more salt, pepper, and spices as desired.
6. Serve garnished with pepitas.

## Variations

### Coconut All the Way

Use coconut milk in place of soymilk, and cut the coconut oil in half. This exaggerates the coconut flavor but is less healthy.

You can also drizzle some coconut cream over the soup as a garnish.
