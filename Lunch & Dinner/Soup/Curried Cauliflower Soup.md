**Vegan**

**Time:** 1 hour

## Description

This hearty, peppery soup gets rave reviews. The basil garnish is a must, as is serving it hot--trust me, these take the soup from good to great.

## Ingredients

- 1 large head of **cauliflower**, broken into small florets, stems chopped
- 4+ Tbsp melted unrefined **coconut oil**, divided
- 1 medium **onion**, diced
- 2 Tbsp **Thai red curry paste**
- 1/2 tsp **lemon zest**
- 1/2 cup unoaked **white wine** (like Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio, although I confess to often using whatever is at hand)
- 1 1/2 cups **vegetable broth**
- 2 cups **soy milk**
- 1/2 tsp **sugar**
- 1 tsp **rice vinegar** or white vinegar
- **Salt** and freshly ground **black pepper**
- **chives** or green onions, chopped for garnish
- fresh **basil**, chopped for garnish

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
2. Toss the cauliflower with enough coconut oil to lightly coat it (up to 3 Tbsp). Spread the cauliflower in a single layer on a large baking sheet and roast until the tips of the cauliflower are golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes.
3. In a Dutch oven or large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, warm 2 Tbsp of the coconut oil until shimmering. Add the onion and a dash of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is turning translucent, about 3 minutes.
4. Add the curry paste and lemon zest and stir to incorporate. Raise the heat to medium-high, add the wine, and cook, stirring frequently, until most of the wine has evaporated.
5. Add all of the roasted cauliflower stems and half of the florets to the pot. Add the vegetable broth, soy milk, and sugar. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, stirring occasionally. Continue simmering for 5 to 10 more minutes to meld the flavors. Remove the pot from the heat.
6. Let the soup cool for a few minutes, then carefully use an immersion blender to blend until smooth.
7. Stir in the vinegar, plus salt and pepper to taste. If the soup needs more acidity, add more vinegar.
8. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with cauliflower florets, basil, and chives.

## Variations

### More Coconut!

Instead of the soy milk, use 1 can (14 ounces) of **light coconut milk**. This will give you a fuller coconut flavor at a slight nutritional cost. You may wish to halve the coconut oil or replace it with olive oil.
