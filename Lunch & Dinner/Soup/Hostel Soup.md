## Description

If you're travelling or just lazy, you'll appreciate this basic soup that takes advantage of easily transportable and/or widely accessible ingredients. Customize avidly and enjoy.

## Ingredients

- 1 can **beans**, drained (unless they're in sauce)
- 2 large **carrots**
- 1 medium **potato**
- 1-2 cubes **bouillon**

## Instructions

1. Heat the bouillon in the appropriate amount of water on the stove, stirring to dissolve the cubes.
2. Slice the potato and carrots and add them to the broth. Pour in the beans as well.

## Variations

### Pasta

Instead of a potato, use pasta. Cook the pasta in the broth alongside the carrot.

### Anything Goes

This soup is paricularly forgiving, so add whatever's at hand: other canned veggies (e.g., corn, tomatoes, green beans), fresh greens, a drizzled egg, butter, you name it!
