# Chili

**Vegan**  
**Servings:** 6  
**Time:** 1-1.5 hours

## Description

This chili is hearty, healthy, relatively easy to make, and it pleases herbivores and omnivores alike. It's also an aesthetically lovely dish! Especially nice in winter.

I often go heavy on the spices. You can also play fast and loose with the vegetable amounts/ratios and the types of beans used.

This dish will keep well in the refrigerator for about a week, or you can freeze it for longer-term storage.

## Ingredients

*Note:* A can is assumed to be 15 oz, and drained unless otherwise stated.

- 3 Tbsp extra-virgin **olive oil**
- 2 **bell peppers**
- 2 large **carrots**
- 2 ribs **celery**
- 2 cans **diced tomatoes** with juices
- 1 can **garbanzo beans**
- 1 can **black beans**
- 1 can **beans of choice** (e.g., black, kidney, pinto, great northern)
- 1 can **corn**
- 2 cups **vegetable broth**
- 4 cloves **garlic**, pressed
- 2 Tbsp **chili powder**
- 2 tsp ground **cumin**
- 1 1/2 tsp **smoked paprika**
- 1 tsp dried **oregano**
- 1 **bay leaf**
- 1/2 tsp **salt**, plus more to taste
- 1 **avocado**

## Instructions

1. Chop the bell peppers, carrots, and celery.
2. In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the chopped vegetables and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir to combine and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender (about 7 to 10 minutes).
3. Add the garlic, chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika and oregano. Cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 1 minute.
4. Add the diced tomatoes and their juices, drained beans, corn, vegetable broth, and bay leaf. Stir to combine and let the mixture come to a simmer. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally and reducing heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer, for 30 minutes. Remove the chili from the heat.
5. For the best texture and flavor, transfer 1 Â½ cups of the chili to a blender, making sure to get some of the liquid portion. Securely fasten the lid and blend until smooth (watch out for hot steam), then pour the blended mixture back into the pot. (Or, you can blend the chili briefly with an immersion blender, or mash the chili with a potato masher until it reaches a thicker, more chili-like consistency.)
6. Add salt (and more of the spices) to taste.
7. Serve garnished with the avocado.

## Variations

For folks that like onions, add a medium red onion at the same time as the other chopped veggies. Wait until the onion is translucent to add the spices.

Other potential toppings include tortilla chips, chopped cilantro, or cheese/sour cream for the non-vegans out there.
