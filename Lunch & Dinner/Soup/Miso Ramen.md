**Vegan**  
**Servings:** 2  
**Time:** 25 min

## Description

After watching Tampopo, my sister and I were in the mood for ramen. Since the wait at our local restaurant was 2 hours, we decided to try slapping some together at home. This recipe was extremely satisfying given how easy it is! There's lots of room to play around with toppings.

## Ingredients

### Soup Base
- 1 Tbsp **sesame oil**
- 1 tsp **ginger**, minced or grated
- 2 cloves **garlic**, minced or pressed
- 2 **scallions**, chopped with (white parts)
- 1 1/2 Tbsp **miso paste**
- 1 Tbsp **nut butter** (e.g. peanut or Asian sesame paste)
- 1/2 - 1 Tbsp **chili sauce** (e.g. doubanjiang)
- 2 cups **vegetable broth**
- 1 cup **soy milk**
- 1 Tbsp **chili oil**
- 1 Tbsp **soy sauce**

### Noodles and Toppings
- 1 head **bok choy** or other leafy greens
- 1 brick of **instant ramen**
- 2 **dried shiitake mushrooms**
- 1/2 cup **corn kernels**
- 2 **scallions**, chopped (green parts)
- toasted **sesame seeds**
- **chili oil**

## Instructions

1. Heat the sesame oil in a pot over medium high heat.
1. Add in the garlic, ginger, and white parts of the scallion. Saute for 1-2 min.
1. Lower the heat to medium and add the nut butter, chili paste, stock, and soy milk. Mix until combined.
1. Add the chili oil and dried mushrooms. Then cover and leave to boil over medium high heat (~5 min).
1. Once the soup boils, lower heat to a simmer, add the miso, and adjust spicing to taste. 
1. Add your veggies of choice.
1. When the veggies are almost done, add the ramen brick. Cook only until quite chewy.
1. Top with corn, green scallions, sesame seeds, and finally chili oil to serve.

## Variations

### Thicker Broth

If you prefer a thick, strong broth, reduce the vegetable broth and soy milk by up to half. Then don't add this all to the pot at once: add up to 1 tsp corn starch with a little of the liquid and mix to get a thick paste before pouring in the rest of the stock/milk.

### Doing it Slow and Right

The original author of this quick-and-easy version has another, more involved recipe for those that want the real deal: [Tantanmen (Vegan Ramen)](https://thefoodietakesflight.com/tantanmen-vegan-ramen-recipe/). I haven't tried it yet, but it looks pretty scrumptious.
