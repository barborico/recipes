**Servings:** 4  
**Time:** 30 minutes + 12 hours marinating

## Description

Earthy and apple-y: a protein main that tastes like fall.

## Ingredients

### Marinade
- 1 cup **olive oil**
- 1 cup **apple cider**
- 1 **apple**, cut into matchsticks
- 1/4 cup **lemon juice**
- 1 Tbsp **apple cider vinegar**
- 1/4 cup **chives**, chopped
- 1/2 a **fennel bulb**, cut into matchsticks; reserve fronds as a garnish
- 2 Tbsp fresh **mint**, finely chopped
- 2 tsp **garlic**, finely chopped
- (optional) 2 Tbsp fresh **dill**, finely chopped

### Tempeh
- 1 lb **tempeh**
- 1 Tbsp **liquid aminos**

## Instructions

1. Mix together the marinade in a tupperware. Cut the tempeh into 1/4-inch-thick and marinate for 4+ hours in the fridge, ideally overnight.
2. Remove the tempeh from the marinade and saute it over medium heat until golden on both sides and crisp. If needed, do this in multiple batches and/or throw a little olive oil in the pan before adding the tempeh.
3. Extract all solids from the marinade and add them to the pan with all the tempeh. Cook on medium-high heat, stirring frequently, for a couple minutes to evaporate any remaining liquid.
4. Sprinkle the liquid aminos over the tempeh and serve.
