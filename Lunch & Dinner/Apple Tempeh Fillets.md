# Apple Tempeh Fillets

**Vegan**  
**Servings:** 4  
**Time:** 30 minutes + 12 hours marinating

## Description

Earthy and apple-y: a protein main that tastes like fall.

## Ingredients

### Marinade
- 1/2 cup **olive oil**
- 1 cup **apple cider**
- 1 **apple**, cut into matchsticks
- 1/4 cup **lemon juice**
- 1/4 cup **liquid aminos**
- 1 Tbsp **apple cider vinegar**
- 1/4 cup **chives**, chopped
- 1/2 a **fennel bulb**, cut into matchsticks; reserve fronds as a garnish
- 2 Tbsp fresh **mint**, finely chopped
- 2 tsp **garlic**, finely chopped
- (optional) 2 Tbsp fresh **dill**, finely chopped

### Tempeh
- 1 lb **tempeh**
- 1 Tbsp **liquid aminos**

## Instructions

1. Mix together the marinade in a tupperware. Cut the tempeh into 1/4-inch-thick and marinate for 4+ hours in the fridge, ideally overnight.
2. Strain the solids from the marinade and saute over medium-high heat. To get a really even texture, separate out the tempeh first and cook in a thin layer until golden on both sides before adding the other solids. If you're lazy like me, throw it all in the pan on higher heat and stir often.
3. Cook, stirring frequently, until the tempeh is turning golden and crisp and the liquid has evaporated. Sprinkle in more liquid aminos to taste.
