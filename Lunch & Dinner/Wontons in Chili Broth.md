# Wontons in Chili Broth

**Vegan**  
**Servings:** 6  
**Time:** 1 hour (plus time for tofu to freeze)

## Description

These dumplings are super flavorful and hearty. Forming the wontons can be a fun group activity if you've got company for dinner.
When I made these the first time, my housemate proclaimed it her favorite meal I'd ever cooked, so you can bet it'll be back!
Also, thanks to Glo for the tip to add miso.

## Ingredients

### Wontons

- ~60 **wonton wrappers** (~3x3"), thawed at room temperature (they will crack if cold)
- 1 lb extra **firm tofu**, ideally frozen and thawed for maximum flavor absorption
- 1 Tbsp toasted **sesame oil**
- 2 cloves **garlic**, minced or pressed
- 1 small **onion**, diced
- 1 cup **mushrooms** (shiitake preferred), fresh or rehydrated and finely minced
- 1 medium **carrot**, peeled and finely grated
- 2 Tbsp **soy sauce** to taste
- 1/4 tsp **pepper** to taste
- 2 1/2 tbsp **corn starch** or alternatively potato or arrowroot starch
- (if using frozen tofu) 1/4 cup **vegetable broth**
- (optional) 1 tbsp dark soy sauce for colour, optional

### Broth

Adjust amounts to taste.

- 2 cup **vegetable broth** or hot water (e.g. that used to cook wontons)
- 2-4 Tbsp **soy sauce**
- 1/4 cup **chili garlic paste**
- 1/4 cup **miso paste** (preferably red)
- 2 tsp **sugar**
- 1/4 cup **rice vinegar** or distilled white vinegar
- 4 tsp **sesame oil**
- (optional) 2 tsp **doubanjiang** or more chili sauce

### Garnishes

- toasted **sesame seeds**
- **green onions**, minced

## Instructions

### Preparing the Filling

1. Prepare the tofu by either: a) freezing and thawing it and then squeezing it with your hands or b) pressing it for at least 10 minutes to drain excess liquid.
2. Place the tofu in a bowl and crumble it with your hands or a fork.
3. Heat a medium-sized pan or wok over medium high. Add in the sesame oil.
4. Once hot, add in the onion and garlic and cook for a couple minutes, until fragrant.
5. Add in the carrot and mushrooms and saut√© for another 3 minutes until tender.
6. Add in the crumbled tofu, vegetable broth (if using), soy sauce, pepper, and salt. Mix well, adjust seasoning to taste, and leave to cook for 2 minutes.
7. Add in the cornstarch and mix until well incorporated. This will help bind the mixture together, which should thicken as the starch dissolves.
8. Turn off the heat and transfer the filling to a bowl and leave to cool before using.

### Making the Wontons

1. Fill the wontons. There are many methods and styles you can pick from; see the original recipe linked below for examples with pictures and video.
**TL;DR**: Be careful of overfilling the wrappers, and use water to seal them if pinching/twisting the dough isn't cutting it.
2. Heat water with a pinch of salt in a large pot. Once it's boiling, add the wontons (in batches). Let them cook for ~4 minutes, stirring regularly to prevent sticking. When they're done, the wrappers should be transparent and the wontons should float.
3. Remove the wontons from the water with a slotted spoon and put them in a bowl. Repeat with each batch until all the dumplings are cooked.
4. Optionally, save some of the water to use in the broth.

### Making the Broth

1. In a pot over medium-high heat, add the broth or water, soy sauce, chili garlic paste, miso paste, sugar, vinegar, sesame oil, and optional doubanjiang. Mix well.
2. Adjust spicing to desired taste.

### Putting It All Together

1. Pour the broth over the wontons.
2. Sprinkle the green onions and sesame seeds over the top as a garnish.

## Variations

### Meaty Filling

Here's an alternative (or complementary) filling that's more evocative of traditional meat wontons. Although most of the omnivores I served preferred the tofu!

#### Ingredients

- 20 oz plant-based **ground meat** substitute (Beyond is my family's go-to), thawed at room temperature
- 1 Tbsp **soy sauce**
- 1/2 tsp **salt**
- 1/2 tsp **pepper**
- 2 Tbsp chopped **chives** or spring onions
- 1 Tbsp **cornstarch**

#### Instructions

In a bowl, mix together all of the ingredients.

### Freezing

You can easily make wontons and then freeze them to eat later. Place the wrapped uncooked wontons on a tray, spaced so they don't stick together. Freeze for a couple hours and then transfer to an airtight bag.

When you're ready to cook the wontons, don't bother thawing them; instead just boil the frozen dumplings.
