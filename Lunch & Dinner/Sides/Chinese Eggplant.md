# Chinese Eggplant

**Contains Oysters**  
**Servings:** 6?  
**Time:** 1 hour

## Description

Delicious eggplant dish that works well as a side or over rice. If you're serving it on rice, you can increase the amount of sauce.

## Ingredients

- 2 large **eggplants**
- 4 cloves **garlic**, pressed
- 1/2 Tbsp fresh **ginger**, grated
- 1/2 tsp **brown sugar**
- 3 Tbsp **vegetable oil** or **peanut oil**
- 1 Tbsp **liquid aminos** or **black bean sauce**
- 2 Tbsp **oyster sauce**
- 1 tsp **corn starch**, plus more for coating
- 1 Tbsp **red pepper flakes**
- 1/4 cup **water** or **vegetable stock**

## Instructions

1. Cut the eggplant into medallions about half an inch thick, and subdivide these as necessary.
2. [Salt the eggplant.](../README.md#Salting-Eggplant)
3. In a bowl, mix the liquid aminos or black bean sauce, oyster sauce, corn starch, and water. Stir the sauce well so that the starch dissolves.
4. Dry the eggplant and sprinkle it with corn starch for a light coating.
5. In a large saucepan, heat 2 Tbsp of the oil on medium-high. Add the eggplant and grill until it is soft and the surfaces are darkened (about 10 minutes). Then remove the eggplant from the pan and set it aside.
6. Add the remaining 1 Tbsp of oil, ginger, garlic, and pepper flakes to the pan and sautee, stirring, until fragrant.
7. Reduce the heat slightly. Add the eggplant back to the skillet and pour the sauce over it, stirring until the eggplant is evenly coated.
8. Remove from heat and serve!

## Variations

### Deep Frying

Deep frying the eggplant rather than pan frying it gives it more of a classic crispy-on-the-outside, soft-on-the-inside texture. However, this requires a lot more oil and is not as healthy.
