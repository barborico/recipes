# Connie's Brussel Sprouts

**Vegan**  
**Servings:** variable  
**Time:** 30 minutes

## Description

Roasted brussel sprouts, deliciously crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Connie got mom hooked on this one!

## Ingredients

- **brussel sprouts**
- **olive oil**
- **salt**
- **black pepper**

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees, with a jelly roll pan inside.
2. Cut the brussel sprouts in half and toss with the oil, salt, and pepper.
3. When the oven is preheated, spread the brussels on the pan and put it back in the oven. Cook for 15-20 minutes, until the brussels are dark and crispy on the outside.
4. Eat immediately! These are much better fresh than reheated.

## Variations

For a more even texture, cook at 400 degrees for 35-40 minutes.
