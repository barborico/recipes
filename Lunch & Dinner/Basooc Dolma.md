# Basooc Dolma

**Vegan**  
**Servings:** 15?  
**Time:** hours, or weeks if pickling your own cabbage

## Description

This is another fantastic item courtesy of the Martirossyans. It is an Armenian dish of pickled cabbage stuffed with spiced grains and legumes. A labor of love, but very worthwhile!

## Ingredients

### Cabbage

I highly recommend buying **pickled cabbage leaves** for the wrapping. If you choose to pickle the cabbage yourself, you'll need a good head start and the following:
- green **cabbage**
- **salt**
- **water**

### Filling

> **Note**: Tsitron is also known as 'kondar or, in English, 'savory.' Fresh or dried savory might not be readily available in all locations. Ground savory is generally available in the spice section of grocery stores.

> **Note**: Maya scoffs at the idea of using rice or any grain other than bulgur.

- 700 grams (approx. 3 cups) of **olive oil**
- 1 kg (2.2 lbs. or about 4 cups) red **onion**, chopped
- 0.5 kg (about 2 cups) dried **red beans**, precooked
- 0.5 kg (about 2 cups) dried **peas**, precooked
- 0.5 kg (about 2 cups) dried **chickpeas**, precooked
- 0.5 kg (about 2 cups) uncooked **lentils**
- 300-400 gram (about 12 oz. or 1 ½ cups) uncooked **grains** (spelt or cracked wheat, aka bulgur)
- 250 g (about 1 ¼ cups) uncooked **rice**
- 2 Tbsp **salt**
- 1 Tbsp mild **red pepper** (e.g paprika or Aleppo red pepper)
- **black pepper**
- 4 Tbsp **tomato paste**
- dried **tsitron**
- dried **basil**
- fresh **cilantro**
- fresh **parsley**

## Instructions

### Pickling Cabbage

1. Create a brine by mixing salt and water in the ratio 40-50 gram (about 2 ½ to 3 Tbsp.) to 1 liter (approx. 4 cups).
1. Add the cabbage leaves to the brine and let sit for about 2 weeks. If you want it to go faster, you can scald the leaves briefly first.

### Filling

1. Add the chopped up onions to the olive oil in a large pot on the stove over medium heat.
1. When the onions become golden, add the red pepper, tsitron, and a little basil, and leave them to cook together, at least for 5 minutes.
1. Add the tomato paste and wait a couple more minutes.
1. Add the cooked red beans, peas, chickpeas, lentils, grains, and rice. Mix well.
1. Add the salt, chopped cilantro, and parsley. Again, mix it well, cover the pot and leave it for about 30 minutes.

### Dolma

1. Spoon the filling into the middle of each cabbage leaf and wrap well. When each dolma is finished, set it gently into a large pot.
1. Pour a little water over the dolma and cook covered for 30 minutes. Allow the dolma to cool in the pot.
1. Serve cold and enjoy!

## Variations

### Un-pickled Cabbage

Only do this if you're rushed. :)

1. Add 6 cups of water to another pot over high heat and add 1 Tbsp of salt.
1. Get the large head of cabbage, and remove the leaves from the stem. When the water begins to boil, add the leaves into the boiling water.
1. When the leaves of the cabbage become softer/tender, remove them and put them into cold water right away.
1. Cut out the very tough areas of the cabbage leaves, so that they will not interfere when you are wrapping the dolma.
