## Description

Kudos to Elisabeth for finding this one! Even done vegan, it's been a big hit with omnivores.

## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp **olive oil**
- 1 cup chopped **yellow onion**
- 1 lb **Beyond Beef ground**
- 2 tsp **parsley**, dried or fresh and minced
- 1 tsp **rosemary**, dried or fresh and minced
- 1 tsp **thyme**, dried or fresh and minced
- 1/2 tsp **salt**
- 1/2 tsp ground **black pepper**
- 1 Tbsp **Worcestershire sauce**
- 2 **garlic cloves**, minced or pressed
- 2 Tbsp **flour**
- 2 Tbsp **tomato paste**
- 1 cup **vegetable stock**
- 1/2 cup **peas**, frozen
- 1/2 cup **carrots**, frozen
- 1/2 cup **corn**, frozen

### Potato Topping

- 1 1/2 - 2 lb **russet potatoes**, peeled and cut into 1 inch cubes
- 1/2 cup **butter**
- 1/3 cup **half & half**

## Instructions

### Meaty Filling

1. Add the oil to a large skillet and place it over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add the onions. Cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
2. Add the Beyond Beef to the skillet and break it apart with a wooden spoon. Add the parsley, rosemary, thyme, salt, and and pepper. Stir well. Cook for 6-8 minutes, until the meat is browned, stirring occasionally.
3. Add the Worcestershire sauce and garlic and stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute.
4. Add the flour and tomato paste. Stir until well incorporated and no clumps of tomato paste remain.
5. Add the broth and frozen peas, carrots, and corn. Bring the liquid to a boil then reduce to simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
6. Set the meat mixture aside and preheat the oven to 400°.

### Potato Topping

1. Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover them with water. Bring the water to a boil, and then reduce to a simmer. Cook until potatoes are fork tender, 10-15 min.
2. Drain the potatoes in a colander and then return them to the hot pot. Let the potatoes rest in the hot pot for 1 minute to evaporate any remaining liquid.
3. Add butter, half & half, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mash the potatoes and stir until all the ingredients are mixed together.
4. Add the nooch or parmesan cheese to the potatoes. Stir until well combined.

### Final Assembly

1. Pour the meat mixture into a baking dish and spread it out into an even layer. Spoon the mashed potatoes on top of the meat and spread it into an even layer.
2. If the baking dish looks very full, place it on a rimmed baking sheet so that the filling doesn’t bubble over into your oven. Bake uncovered for 25-30 minutes. 
3. Cool for 15 min before serving. I strongly recommend drizzling with sriracha for the spice lovers out there.

## Variations

We've made this with meat from "wild caught, free range" Texas boars (which are notoriously invasive), and it came out quite tasty, if not as flavorful as the Beyond Beef. :)
