# Simple Stir Fry

**Vegan**  
**Servings:** 4  
**Time:** 30 minutes

## Description

This is my lazy stir fry. You can easily shake it up by adding more/different veggies. If serving this over rice, you might increase the amount of sauce.

## Ingredients

### Base

- 2 **eggplants**
- 2 **bell peppers**
- 1 head of **cauliflower**
- 1 pack of **tempeh** or extra-firm **tofu**
- 1 Tbsp **olive oil**
- (optional) 3 cloves **garlic**, minced

### Sauce

- 2 Tbsp **olive oil**
- 2 Tbsp **soy sauce** or **liquid aminos**
- 1 Tbsp **sesame oil**
- 2 tsp**sriracha**

## Instructions

1. Chop the veggies and [salt the eggplant](../README.md#Salting%20Eggplant). Cut the protein into strips.
2. Mix the sauce in a bowl. Pour 1/4 into a small pan and set the rest aside.
3. Add the protein to the pan and fry until golden.
4. In a larger pan, add 1 Tbsp olive oil and the garlic, if using it. Heat this, stirring often, until the garlic is fragrant.
5. Add the cauliflower, cover, and cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally. Then add the eggplants and the rest of the sauce, mixing well to coat. Cook uncovered until the eggplant is starting to soften and then add the peppers.
6. When the veggies are about done, stir in the protein and serve.
