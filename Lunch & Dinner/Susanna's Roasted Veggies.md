## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
2. Cut the eggplant into quarter-circles, about 1/2 inch thick.
3. Fill a bowl with water and add 1/2 tsp salt. Immerse the eggplant in this salt water and let it sit for 10 minutes to draw out the bitter juices.
4. Chop the tomatoes and bell peppers. Cut each clove of garlic into 3-4 pieces.

6. Roast the veggies in the oven, stirring every 15 minutes, until done (about 45 minutes).
