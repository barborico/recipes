**Vegan**  
**Servings:** 6  
**Time:** 60 minutes

## Description

This is a hearty, cheesy-ish dish with a satisfying noodly texture. Thanks to Elisabeth for this one!

## Ingredients

- 2 **spaghetti squash**
- 3 Tbsp **olive oil**, plus more for brushing
- **salt** and **pepper** to taste
- 6-8 cloves **garlic**, minced
- 1 tsp **cayenne pepper**
- 2 cups chopped **broccoli**
- ~2 cups **vegetable stock**
- 2 cups mashed **beans** (e.g. cannellini)
- 2/3 cup **nutritional yeast**

## Instructions

> **Note**: These steps should be followed asynchronously.

1. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.
1. To roast the squash, cut it into rings about 1-inch thick, remove the seeds, brush both sides with olive oil, spread over a baking sheet, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
1. Bake the squash for 30 minutes until it is soft but not mushy, then let it cool for about 10 min.
1. While the squash is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and add minced garlic and red pepper flakes.
1. When the garlic is fragrant and starting to brown, add broccoli florets and half of the vegetable stock. Season with salt and pepper and turn the heat down to medium-low. Cook until the stock is evaporated and the broccoli is bright green and al dente.
1. Add mashed cannellini beans and nutritional yeast. Stir the mixture together, adding more stock a tablespoon at a time until the mixture is the consistency of a thick cheese sauce.
1. Peel the skin off the outside of the squash rings. Working over a bowl, pull apart the strands of spaghetti squash, one ring at a time.
1. Add the spaghetti squash to the cheesy broccoli, with more stock to reach the desired consistency. The sauce should be coating the squash, but it shouldn't be too wet.

## Variations

### Swap Brassicas

Use cauliflower instead of broccoli--both taste great here!

### Add Protein

Meat substitutes like TVP can work well in this dish. Add them alongside the squash.
