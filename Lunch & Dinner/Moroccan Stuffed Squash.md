# Moroccan Stuffed Squash

**Vegan**  
**Servings:** 8  
**Time:** 60 minutes

## Description

Fall and winter are squash seasons! This is a great way to use acorn or similar squash.

## Ingredients

> **Note**: The spice amounts are approximate.

- 4 **acorn squash** (about 5 pounds total), halved lengthwise, seeds removed
- 3 Tbsp canola or **olive oil**, plus extra for brushing
- 1 tsp **salt**, plus extra for sprinkling
- 2 tsp **cinnamon**
- 2 Tbsp **coriander**
- 2 tsp **cumin**
- 1 Tbsp smoked **paprika**
- 3/4 - 1 tsp **cayenne pepper**
- 1/2 tsp **turmeric**
- 1 cup finely chopped **onion**
- 5 medium cloves finely chopped **garlic**
- 3 cans **chickpeas**
- 2 cans **diced tomatoes**
- (optional) 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh **cilantro**

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F.
1. Cut a small slice off the bottom of each squash half so it will sit nicely when stuffed. Brush the insides and cut edges with oil and sprinkle with salt. Place the squash cut-side down on the prepared pan. Bake until tender but still firm, 40 to 45 minutes.
1. In a small bowl, mix the spices: cinnamon, coriander, cumin, paprika, cayenne to taste, turmeric and the salt.
1. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring often, until starting to brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
1. Stir the spice blend into the onion and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add chickpeas and the tomatoes with their juice. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Stir in the cilantro.
1. Fill each baked squash half to the max the chickpea stew.
