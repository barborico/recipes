# Sesame-Sriracha Sliders

**Vegan**  
**Servings:** 4  
**Time:** 45 minutes, plus 12 hours to freeze and thaw tofu

## Description

This is probably the favorite vegan main course in my omnivorous household. It's wonderfully flavorful and the tofu keeps well so you can keep making sliders throughout the week.

## Ingredients

### The Tofu
- 1/4 cup **vegetable broth**
- 1/4 cup **liquid aminos**
- 1/4 cup **sriracha**
- 1 Tbsp **maple syrup**
- 1 Tbsp **tomato paste**
- 1 tsp **liquid smoke**
- 1 tsp **ancho chile powder** or regular chili powder
- 1 tsp smoked **paprika**
- 1/2 tsp **cumin**
- 2 tsp toasted **sesame oil**
- 1/2 a **red onion**, diced
- 2 cloves of **garlic**, minced
- 1 inch of fresh **ginger**, grated
- 1 14-oz block of extra-firm **tofu**, ideally frozen and thawed
- 1/3 cup **sesame seeds**, toasted
- (optional) fresh **parsley**, chopped

### The Sliders
- **bread**, such as buns or (my favorite) ciabatta rolls
- vegan **mayonnaise** or aoli
- **kimchi** or sliced pickles
- **green onions**, chopped
- (optional) **arugula**

## Instructions

### The Tofu
1. For the best texture and flavor, freeze the tofu beforehand. When the tofu thaws, you should be able to squeeze out most of the water and crumble it easily. While this step takes extra time, it's worth it--trust me.
1. Combine the broth, liquid aminos, sriracha, syrup, tomato paste, and spices in a bowl and set aside.
1. In a large frying pan, head the sesame oil over medium heat. Add the onion and saute for a couple minutes, then add the garlic and ginger and saute a minute longer.
1. After the tofu has been squeezed or pressed to remove water, crumble it into the pan. Promptly add in the liquid mixture and stir well. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is fully absorbed (usually ~10 minutes).
1. Remove the tofu from heat and stir in the sesame seeds and parsley, if you're using it.

### The Sliders
1. Heat or toast the bread, if you like.
1. Spread on a layer of mayo. This adds complementary creaminess and helps to cut the spice.
1. Pile on the other ingredients: kimchi, tofu, and arugula, if you're using it.
1. Sprinkle green onions on top and serve.

## Variations

### Lazy

If you don't have time to freeze and thaw the tofu, just press out as much water as possible beforehand.
