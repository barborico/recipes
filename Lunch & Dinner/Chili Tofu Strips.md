# Chili Tofu Strips

**Vegan**  
**Servings:** variable  
**Time:** 1 hour

## Description

A simple, high-protein snack or side. All credit to my mother.

## Ingredients

- extra firm **tofu**
- **chili powder**
- **cumin**
- **garlic salt**
- **flour**
- unrefined **coconut oil**

## Instructions

1. Press the tofu for at least an hour to expel extra water. This will improve the texture of the strips and make them easier to cut.
2. Mix the spices in equal parts, with two parts flour for every one part of the individual spices.
3. Cut the tofu into thin strips and coat these strips in the spice mixture.
4. Melt coconut oil in a pan and use it to fry the strips until they are golden. Voila!
