# Aubyn's Salad Dressing

**Vegan**  
**Servings:** 6  
**Time:** 10 minutes

## Description

What makes Aubyn's salads so delightful? It's partly the homegrown vegetables, and partly this salad dressing which can turn leafy greens alone into a satisfying dish. I can enthusiastically devour a bowl of just kale or lettuce if I've got this dressing at the ready.

## Ingredients

- 1/3 cup extra virgin **olive oil**
- 2/3 cup **nutritional yeast**
- 3 cloves **garlic**, pressed
- 2 Tbsp **mustard**, dijon preferred
- 1 1/2 Tbsp **liquid aminos** or soy sauce
- 1 1/2 Tbsp **apple cider vinegar**
- **black pepper** to taste 
- (optional) 1 tsp **sriracha**
- (optional) 1/2 tsp **sesame oil**
- (optional) 1 Tbsp fresh grated **ginger**

## Instructions

Mix all ingredients and adjust ratios as desired. If you're putting this on a tougher green like kale, you can massage or crush the leaves before dressing to tenderize them and get better absorption of the dressing.
