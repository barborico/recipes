Amazing fall salad! Super nutty and flavorful, it works well as a side or main. This is now a Thanksgiving must-have for me. Thank you Marita for this recipe!

## Ingredients

### Salad
- 1/2 cup **hazelnuts**, chopped
- 1/2 Tbsp **liquid aminos**
- 1/8 tsp **cinnamon**
- 1/8 tsp **smoked paprika**
- 1 medium to large **delicata or honeynut squash**
- 1/2 tsp **salt**
- 1/4 tsp **pepper**
- 1 bunch **kale**
- 1/2 **lemon**, juiced
- 2 Tbsp **olive oil**
- 1 crisp **apple**

### Dressing
- 1 clove **garlic**
- 1/4 cup **peanut butter**
- 2 Tbsp **tahini**
- 1 1/2 Tbsp **dijon mustard**
- 2 tsp **maple syrup**
- 1 1/2 Tbsp **apple cider vinegar**
- 1 Tbsp **white miso paste**
- 1/8 tsp **cayenne**
- 1/8 tsp **smoked paprika**
- 1/8 tsp **salt**
- 1/8 tsp **pepper**
- 1/2 cup **water**

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325F and toast the hazelnuts for ~10 min until they're aromatic and golden.
2. Immediately transfer the nuts to a small bowl and add the liquid aminos, cinnamon, and paprika. Toss to coat evenly and set aside.
3. Increase the oven temperature to 400F. De-seed the squash and cut it into thin half-moons and then toss with 1 Tbsp of the oil, salt, and pepper. Arrange the slices on a baking sheet so they don't overlap and roast for 20 min.
4. Remove the stems from the kale and tear the leaves into bite-sized pieces. Massage them with your hands to tenderize.
5. Cut the apple into small chunks and add it to the salad. Pour the lemon juice over the apple and kale and mix.
6. Combine all of the dressing ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth.
7. Add the squash, nuts, and dressing to the salad and stir to combine. Then serve!
