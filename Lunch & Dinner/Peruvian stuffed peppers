Peruvian Stuffed Peppers
Vegan
Servings: 8
Time: 60 minutes

Description
Another great Elan-introed flexipe.

Ingredients
Note: The spice amounts are to taste.

8 bell peppers (preferably red, orange, yellow for sweetness)
3 Tbsp canola or olive oil
1 tsp salt, plus extra for sprinkling
2 tsp Glo's cajun spice
2 tsp cumin
1 Tbsp smoked paprika
2 diced onions
5 medium cloves finely chopped garlic
1 cup wild rice, cooked
1 lb beyond beef
1/2 cup raisins
(optional) 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro

Instructions
Preheat oven to 375Â°F.
Soak the raisins in warm water for at least 10 minutes.
Cut the stem out of each pepper and scoop out the seeds. Cook until browned and take out to cool (there will be some liquid inside that will need to be poured out of each).
Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring often, until starting to brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
Stir the spice blend into the onion and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add beyond meat and cook until browned. 
Add soaked raisins and mix in evenly.
Fill each baked pepper to the max with the beyond beef filling.

Variations

Use currents instead of raisins.
Can add in various roasted diced veggies.
