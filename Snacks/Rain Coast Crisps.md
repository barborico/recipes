# Rain Coast Crisps

**Vegan**  
**Servings:** ~100 crackers  
**Time:** 2 hours, plus lots of waiting

## Description

These crackers are better and cheaper than the store bought variety. They're a healthy snack and a guaranteed hit with guests and parties--especially when served with goat cheese.

The crackers keep well for about a month in a sealed container.

## Ingredients

*Note:* nuts and seeds should be unsalted.

- 2 cups **flour**
- 2 tsp **baking soda**
- 1/2 tsp **salt**
- 2 cups **soy milk** (or yogurt, buttermilk, whatever's in the fridge)
- 1/4 cup **brown sugar**
- 1/4 cup **honey** or more brown sugar
- 1 cup dried **raisins**, cranberries, currants, and/or figs
- 1/2 cup chopped and roasted **pecans**
- 1/2 cup roasted **pumpkin seeds**
- 1/2 cup roasted **sunflower seeds**
- 1/4 cup **sesame seeds**
- 1/4 cup **flax seeds**
- 1 Tbsp chopped fresh **rosemary**

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda and salt. Add the buttermilk, brown sugar and honey and stir a few strokes. Add the raisins, pecans, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, flax seed and rosemary and stir just until blended.
3. Pour the batter into two 8x4-inch loaf pans that have been sprayed with nonstick spray. Bake for about 35 minutes, until golden and springy to the touch.
4. Remove from the pans and cool on a wire rack. The cooler the bread, the easier the next steps will be; you can leave it until the next day or pop it in the freezer. 
5. Preheat the oven to 300°F. Alternately, you can use a dehydrator for drying the crackers, though this doesn't give the toasty flavor.
6. Slice the loaves as thin as you can (a mandoline is super helpful) and place the slices in a single layer on an ungreased cookie sheet.
7. Bake the slices for about 15 minutes, then flip them over and bake for another 10 minutes, until crisp and deep golden.

## Variations

### Freezing

After step 4, feel free to freeze the loaves and resume the process down the road.

### Bread

Stop at step 6 and eat the crackers like slices of delightfully fruity and nutty bread.

### Mix It Up

Try different nuts and dried fruits for new flavors!
