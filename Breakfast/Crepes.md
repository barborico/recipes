# Crepes

**Vegetarian**  
**Servings:** 12 crepes  
**Time:** 30 minutes, plus 30+ more waiting

## Description

Blah blah

*NOTES*:
- Take note!

## Ingredients

- 3 Tbsp **butter**, melted and cooled
- 1 cup **flour**
- 1 Tbsp **sugar**
- 1/8 tsp **salt**
- 3/4 cup **milk**
- 1/2 cup **water**
- 2 **eggs**
- 1 1/2 tsp **vanilla extract**

## Instructions

1. Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend on medium-high speed for half a minute.
1. Refrigerate the mixture for at least half an hour. You can even make this the day before cooking. This step enables the flour to hydrate and enhances the flavor.
1. Set a skillet over medium heat. Optionally, before cooking each crepe, butter the pan for extra flavor and crispiness and to prevent sticking (if not using a no-stick pan).
1. Pour or spoon just enough batter into the pan so that you can tilt it in all directions and the bottom will be covered as thinly as possible.
1. Let the crepe cook until you can see that the edges have started to brown, usually one to two minutes.
1. Flip the crepe and cook for another ~40 seconds.
1. Fill the crepe and serve! Some tasty sweet toppings are:
   - syrups
   - jams
   - fruit
   - honey
   - chocolate
   - whipped cream
   - nuts or nut butter
   - spices (e.g. cinnamon sugar)

## Variations

### Dairy-Free

You can easily substitute in soymilk and vegan butter.

### Lazy

The most basic recipe that works but creates thicker crepes is to just mix the following together and cook:
- 1/2 cup **flour**
- 1/2 cup **milk**
- 1 **egg**
- 1 pinch **salt**

### Savory

For savory crepes, you can leave out the vanilla and/or sugar and instead add a pinch of black pepper or other spice/herb.
