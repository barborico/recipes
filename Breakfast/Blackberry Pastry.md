# Blackberry Pastry

**Vegetarian**  
**Servings:** 6  
**Time:** 45 min

## Description

This is an aesthetic and delicious breakfast treat, as well as being my favorite use of the bountiful Himalayan blackberries that cover the Pacific Northwest every summer.

## Ingredients

### Dough

- 2 cups **flour**
- 1 cup **butter**
- 1 cup **sour cream** or **plain yogurt**

### Filling

- 2-3 cups **blackberries** (I use frozen Himalayan)
- 1/4 cup **cornstarch** dissolved in cold water
- 1/2-1 cup **sugar**, depending on the tartness of the berries

### Glaze

- 2 Tbsp **milk**
- 1 cup **powdered sugar**

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350Â°.
2. Add the filling ingredients to a saucepan and cook over medium heat until thick.
3. Make the dough by cutting the butter into the flour in a mixing bowl. Once the butter chunks are roughly the size of blueberries, stir in the sour cream or yogurt.
4. Liberally flour a surface and rolling pin and then divide the dough in half. For each piece, roll it out, fold it over itself in thirds, and repeat twice more to get thin layers of butter for maximal flakiness. The final shape should be vaguely rectangular and somewhat smaller than your baking sheet.
5. Transfer the rolled dough to the baking sheet and deposit half of the filling along the center of each in a band that leaves a ~2 inch perimeter of dough. Use scissors to cut radially into the edge of the dough, about 1 1/2 inches long and spaced 1 inch apart except for the strips on the ends which should be ~3 in wide. Then, starting at one end and alternating along both sides, fold the strips in towards the center of the pastry so that they overlap slightly. When you finish, the filling should be contained and the pastry should almost resemble a fishtail braid.
6. Bake the pastries for 35 min, or until the dough becomes golden. While they cook, create the glaze by mixing the milk and powdered sugar.
7. Serve warm and drizzled with glaze. Enjoy!

## Variations

Feel free to substitute in other fillings, such as jams or fruits.
