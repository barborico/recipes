# Salted Caramel

**Vegetarian**  
**Servings:** 64 caramels  
**Time:** 1-5 hours

## Description

This caramel recipe uses high temperatures and soy sauce to cut the sweetness and create a more complex, "adult" flavor. There are lots of variations to play around with the flavor and texture, but it's impossible to go wrong with this base.

Serve as individual candies, drizzle over cake or ice cream, or use to sweeten other dishes with a salty, caramely kick!

## Ingredients

- 14 1/2 oz **sugar**
- 1/2 cup **water**
- 1/2 cup **light corn syrup**
- 1/4 tsp **cream of tartar**
- 1 cup **heavy cream**, room temperature
- 2 tsp **soy sauce**
- 8 Tbsp **unsalted butter**, room temperature
- 1 tsp coarse sea **salt**

## Instructions

1. Line the bottom and sides of an 8-inch square pan with parchment paper.
2. Combine the sugar, water, corn syrup, and cream of tartar in a heavy 4-quart saucepan and put over high heat. Stir occasionally until the sugar has dissolved. Cover and continue to cook for 5 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, combine the heavy cream and soy sauce in a liquid measuring cup. Cut the butter into ~8 pieces and have it and the cream mixture standing by.
4. Remove the lid from the sugar mixture, and attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan. When the sugar mixture reaches 230 degrees, reduce the heat to medium and cook, without stirring, until the syrup is a golden color and is approaching 300 degrees, about 6 to 7 minutes. At this point, there is less likelihood of any crystallization, so gently swirl the pan to break up any hot pockets.
5. When the temperature approaches 350 degrees, it will turn deep amber. Remove the pan from the heat, and gently swirl again to break up all of the hot pockets. Cool for 2 minutes.
6. Carefully incorporate the cream and soy mixture and the butter into the pan. Stir to combine. Return the caramel to medium heat, stir until the butter is completely melted, and continue cooking until it reaches 255 degrees. Remove from the heat and pour into the parchment-lined pan, tap gently to release air bubbles.
7. Cool on a cooling rack for 30 minutes, and then sprinkle evenly with the salt. Continue cooling on the rack for an additional 3 1/2 hours. Cut into 1-inch pieces and wrap individually in parchment. Store in an airtight container for up to a week. 

## Variations

### Chocolate-Dipped

After step 6, let cool completely. Then cut the squares and dip them in tempered chocolate. Sprinke the salt over the caramels while the chocolate is wet.

### Sauce

To make a caramel sauce, simply adjust the temperatures used in this recipe. TODO

### Dairy-Free

Replace the heavy cream with coconut cream and the butter with refined coconut oil (solid at room temperature). Note that this will turn out with a distinct coconut flavor. If you want to lean into this, use unrefined coconut oil which retains the coconut flavor.

### Flavoring

Play around with different salts for the finish. This can lead to wildly different flavors!

You can also flavor the cream, e.g. by boiling with espresso powder, before you add it.
