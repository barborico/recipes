## Description

"These are the best waffles I've ever had." -- my housemate

This recipe takes waffles to a new level. They are heavy, yeasty, and desserty, although they can work as a breakfast if you're feeling decadent. I recommend topping with fruit, whipped cream, and/or [orange syrup](Chocolate-Covered%20Candied%20Orange%20Peel.md).

## Ingredients

- 1 0.25 oz package **dry yeast**
- 1 1/2 Tbsp **sugar**
- 3/4 cup **soy milk**, room temperature
- 3 **eggs** (thanks, Marie Curie!)
- 1 cup **butter**, melted
- 2 tsp **vanilla extract**
- 3 cups **flour**
- 1/2 tsp **salt**
- 1 cup **pearl sugar**

## Instructions

1. Sprinkle the yeast and white sugar over warm milk in a small bowl. The milk should be no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C). Let stand for 15 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam.
2. Whisk the eggs, melted butter, and vanilla extract into the yeast mixture until evenly blended; set aside. Stir together the flour and salt in a separate large bowl, and make a well in the center. Pour the egg mixture into the well, then stir in the flour mixture until a soft dough forms.
3. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.
4. Gently mix in the pearl sugar.
5. Preheat the waffle iron. When it's ready, place a baseball-size ball of dough on the iron (this batter won't expand much). Cook waffles until golden and crisp, about 2 minutes.

## Variations

### Help, I Have No Pearl Sugar!

This recipe works reasonalbly well with regular granulated sugar as long as the sugar is gently folded in rather than mixed; this way, it carmelizes on the outside of the waffle instead of dissolving in the batter.

If you prefer to approximate pearl sugar, add granulated sugar to a saucepan with just enough water to make a wet sand mixture. Then heat this on the stove until it dries in a clumpy fashion. Try not to let the mixture caramelize, although a little bit won't hurt.
