# Pumpkin Pie

**Vegetarian; Dairy-Free**  
**Servings:** 8  
**Time:** 1 hour 15 minutes

## Description

The classic, airy and not too sweet.

## Ingredients

### Crust

- 1 cup all-purpose **flour**
- 1/3 cup **vegan butter**
- 2/3 cup **pecans**, ground
- 1 tsp **brown sugar**
- 1/4 tsp **salt**
- 3+ tsp **ice water**

### Filling

- 3 **eggs** (thanks, Lola!)
- 1/2-2/3 cup **sugar** (white, brown, or blend)
- 1/2 tsp ground **cinnamon**
- 1/2 tsp ground **ginger**
- 1/8 tsp ground **cloves**
- 1/8 tsp ground **nutmeg**
- 1/8 tsp **salt**
- 2 cups pureed **pumpkin** (I often use homemade puree, which contains more water than canned)
- 1 1/2 cups **soy milk**
- 1 Tbsp extra-virgin **olive oil** or refined (unflavored) **coconut oil**

## Instructions

### Crust

1. Grind the pecans finely using a spice or coffee grinder.
2. Combine the flour, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a food processor and pulse a few times to mix.
3. Add the butter and pecans and process until the mixture looks like cornmeal, with pebbles of butter somewhat smaller than peas (about 10 seconds).
4. Move the dough into a mixing bowl and sprinkle the ice water over it until you can make it into a ball with your hands. Do so.
5. Partially flatten the dough into a disk and freeze it for 10 minutes.
6. Dust a surface with flour and roll out the dough. The pecans will make it more prone to crumble, but the flavor is worth it. :)
7. Transfer the dough to a pie pan approximately 8-10 inches in diameter. Prettify the edges and prick it all over with a fork.

### Filling

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
2. Beat the eggs with the sugar, then add the spices and salt. Pour in the pumpkin, soy milk, and oil and mix well.
3. Pour the filling into the pie crust and place in the oven. Bake until the mixture is solid, but shakes like jell-o (usually 45 minutes to an hour).

## Variations

### Richer Crust

Add an egg yolk and another teaspoon of sugar to the crust.

### Prebake Crust

This is recommended by Bitman to add crispiness to the crust. However, beware burning your crusts if using this method.
1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
2. Butter/oil one side of a sheet of tin foil and use this (butter-side down) to cover the raw crust. Weigh it down with something.
3. Bake the crust for 12 minutes.
4. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees, remove the foil, and bake for another 10 minutes. The crust should be a golden brown.
5. While you are baking the crust, heat the filling so that it is hot but not boiling, stirring occasionally.
6. Pour the mixture into the hot crust and bake, about 30-40 minutes.

### Shake up the Squash

Try using a different squash in place of pumpkin for the filling.
