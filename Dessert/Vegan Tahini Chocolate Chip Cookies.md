## Description

Tahini chocolate chip cookies, adapted from the NYT cooking recipe and made vegan.

*NOTES*:
- The measurements for ingredients and timing are precise! Follow them for best results :)

## Ingredients

- 1 stick/113 grams of vegan butter (I find the Trader Joe's Vegan Butter Spread works well https://www.clubtraderjoes.com/trader-joes-vegan-buttery-spread-review/)
- 140 grams of tahini
- 150 grams all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon of salt
- 100 grams of light brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal
- 0.5 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1.5 tablespoons hot water
- 1.5 tablespoons honey
- 225 grams of chocolate (you can use chips, but it would be better to buy a baking bar and cut it into unequal shards)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit.
2. Whisk flaxseed, hot water and honey in a bowl and set aside.
3. Put butter, sugar and tahini into a large bowl and cream together with an egg beater for ~5 minutes until the mixture visibly lightens in color.
4. Add baking soda, baking powder, salt, vanilla and the flaxseed mixture to the bowl and beat for another ~3 minutes.
5. Sift the flour into the mixture and fold in slowly with a wooden spoon or scraper.
6. Add in chocolate and fold in slowly.
7. Divide into 15 equal portions using an ice cream scooper onto a sheet pan lined with a baking sheet or silicon mat.
8. Bake for 11-12 minutes, depending on how hot your oven runs. The cookies may look slightly under done when they come out - don't worry. They will continue to cook and set for another few minutes from the residual heat.
9. Let set for 30 minutes, then enjoy :)
