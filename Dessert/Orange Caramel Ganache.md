# Orange Caramel Ganache

**Vegetarian**  
**Servings:** 60 molded truffles  
**Time:** 40 minutes

## Description

This sweet orange ganache makes a delicious truffle filling and can also be used in cakes (or enjoyed straight). It has a long shelf life and the ganache can keep separately without losing moisture.

## Ingredients

- 150 grams (2/3 cup) **sugar**
- 25 grams **light corn syrup**
- 125 grams (1/2 cup) **heavy cream**
- 150 grams **milk chocolate**
- 10 drops **orange essential oil**
- **water**

## Instructions

1. Combine the sugar and corn syrup in a pan with enough water to make a "wet sand" miture (a 1:4 water-to-sugar ratio is usually sufficient, which is about 1/4 cup here).
2. Over medium-high heat, cook the mixture to an amber caramel color, washing down the sides of the pan with water once the sugar is dissolved to prevent crystallization. You can vary the flavor here by opting for a lighter or darker caramel.
3. Reduce heat to low, pour a third of the cream into the caramel, and mix carefully (expect lots of bubbling and steam). Repeat twice with the remaining cream.
4. Add the chocolate to the pan at 170 degrees or less and stir to melt and mix.
5. Turn off the heat and add the orange oil, mixing well.

## Variations

### Flavored

You can introduce additional flavor by boiling the cream first with, e.g., coffee. Alternately, swap out the orange for a different essential oil.

### Savory

For a more savory truffle, try using dark chocolate, cooking to a darker color in step 2, and/or adding a little (1/2 tsp)soy sauce.

### Dairy-Free

[UNTESTED] Use a vegan [heavy cream substitute](../README.md#Heavy%20Cream).
