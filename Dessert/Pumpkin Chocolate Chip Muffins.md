# Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Muffins

**Vegetarian**  
**Servings:** 12  
**Time:** 45 minutes

## Description

These are a classic from Miwa. I like making them bite-sized, although they tend to go faster that way...

## Ingredients

- 1 3/4 cup **flour**
- 2/3 cup **sugar**
- 1 tsp ground **ginger**
- 1 tsp ground **cinnamon**
- 1/3 tsp ground **cloves**
- 1/3 tsp ground **nutmeg**
- 1/3 tsp ground **allspice**
- 1/2 tsp **baking soda**
- 1/2 tsp **salt**
- 2 **eggs**
- 1 cup pureed **pumpkin**
- 1/2 cup melted **butter** or vegetable oil
- 2/3 cup mini dark **chocolate chips**
- (optional) 1/2 tsp **vanilla extract**

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
2. Mix together the flour, spices, baking soda, and salt.
3. In a separate (larger) bowl, beat the eggs with the sugar, butter, and vanilla until smooth. Then slowly stir in the flour mixture. Finally, add the pumpkin and chocolate chips.
4. Line a muffin tray or spray it with oil. (If you're doing multiple batches, spray between each.) Fill each cup about 3/4 full with the batter.
5. Bake the muffins until a toothpick comes out clean, about 15-20 minutes (varies depending on the muffin size).
6. Place all muffins not to be eaten immediately in a zip-lock bag while they are still warm. This will keep the muffins delightfully moist.
