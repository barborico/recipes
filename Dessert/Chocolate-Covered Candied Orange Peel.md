**Vegan**  
**Servings:** 25  
**Time:** 6 hours, including 4 of waiting

## Description

These are festive and make great gifts. Plus, they're like crack. A by-product of this recipe is orange syrup which tastes phenomenal on waffles.

This process is time-intensive and lends itself to creating large batches at once.

## Ingredients

- 6 thick-skinned **oranges**
- 2 cups **sugar**
- 2 Tbsp **corn syrup**
- 1 lb? **dark chocolate**

## Instructions

1. Score the skin of the oranges longitudinally to remove it in quarters. The fruit is not needed for this recipe.
2. In a medium saucepan, cover the peels with cold water and bring to a boil over high heat. Then turn the heat down and simmer until the peels are tender and the pith is faded (5-10 minutes). Drain off the liquid.
3. Use a grapefruit spoon to gently scrape the pith off the inside of the peels.
4. Cut the peels longitudinally into strips.
5. Combine the sugar, corn syrup, and a cup of water in the saucepan. Boil over medium heat until the mixture reaches 236 degrees; use a candy thermometer to track this.
6. Add the peels to the syrup and cook over low heat until they turn translucent (about 10 minutes). Then turn off the stove and allow the mixture to cool.
6. Remove the peels with tongs or a strainer and dry them on a rack. Reserve the orange syrup, which is a delicious product in its own right.
7. It will take the peels a few hours to dry to the point where they can be dipped in chocolate. Once they are no longer wet to the touch, temper the chocolate and dip the peels.
