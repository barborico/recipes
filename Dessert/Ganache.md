# Ganache

**Vegetarian**  
**Servings:** 25-30? hand-rolled truffles; 30-40? molded  
**Time:** 30 minutes, plus hours more for finishing

## Description

Ganache is the easiest and tastiest part of making chocolate truffles. This recipe outlines the basics of preparing ganache and crafting simple truffles, with a few of my favorite variations. However, there are myriad ways to make a tasty ganache, so experiment!

Truffles can be either molded, dipped, or simply rolled without a chocolate coating (e.g., in cocoa powder). In the first case, structural integrity is provided by the molded chocolate shell and so you want a ganache texture close to that of creamy peanut butter. In the latter cases, you want a firmer ganache that can be rolled or cut when cold and will hold its shape at room temperature.

If you choose to refrigerate the finished truffles, you should remove them from the fridge some 15-30 minutes before serving to get the right consistency.

## Ingredients

- 8 oz **chocolate** (bittersweet, dark, milk, white, or blend)
- **heavy cream**
  - 2/3 cup if molding
  - 1/2 cup if dipping
  - 1/3 cup if rolling

## Instructions

### Ganache
1. Finely chop the chocolate and place into a mixing bowl. Microwave for 30 seconds and stir, repeating until the chocolate is just melted.
2. Bring the cream to a boil and pour it over the chocolate. Wait 15 seconds and stir until the mixture is smooth.
3. Allow the ganache to chill. *Note: For unmolded rectangular truffles, pour the hot ganache into a pan lined with parchment paper to cool. The depth of the chocolate should match the desired height of the truffles.*

### Finish

#### Molded

1. Prepare chocolate molds with tempered chocolate. They should be completely set before filling.
2. Let the ganache cool until it is just above room temperature, but not hot enough to melt the molds.
3. Transfer the ganache to a plastic bag and cut a *small* opening. Pipe the ganache into the molds.
4. Allow the ganache to set, refrigerating as necessary.
5. Bottom the truffles with more tempered chocolate, let them set, and then unmold.

#### Dipped

1. While the ganache is cool enough to be firm but not hard or brittle, cut it into squares or scoop it and hand-roll it into balls. If the outside of the balls is wet, set them back in the fridge to chill before dipping.
2. Use a fork or other utensil to dip the ganache into tempered chocolate. Shake off excess chocolate and deposit the truffle onto a silicone baking mat or wax paper to cool.
3. (Optional) While the chocolate coating is wet, decorate truffles by sprinkling them with toppings (e.g., salt, nuts, sprinkles). Alternately, roll them in a coating as explained [below](#Rolled). Rolling in cocoa powder will create a cool "elephant skin" surface as the chocolate creases and folds.

#### Rolled

1. Form the ganache as explained in step 1 for [dipping](#Dipped).
2. (Optional) While the surface of the truffles is warm, drop them into a coating (e.g. cocoa powder, nuts, shredded coconut) and roll them about until they are covered. Note that the coating won't stick as well as in the case of dipped truffles.

## Variations

### Dairy-Free

Use a vegan [heavy cream substitute](../README.md#Heavy-Cream). I've used the soymilk/coconut oil blend and the resulting flavor and texture are just as good as with heavy cream.

### Peanut Butter

Reduce the cream to 1/3 cup. After step 2 of making the ganache, while the mixture is still hot and fluid, stir in 1/4 cup **peanut butter**.

### Espresso

Add 2 Tbsp instant **espresso powder** to the cream before boiling it.

### Gingerbread

Increase the chocolate to 10 oz. Add 1 oz **light corn syrup** to the cream before boiling it. Then after step 2 of making the ganache, while the mixture is still hot and fluid, stir in the following:
- 2 Tbsp **salted butter**, melted
- 1/2 tsp ground **cinnamon**
- 1/2 tsp ground **ginger**
- 1/8 tsp ground **cloves**
- 1/8 tsp ground **nutmeg**

### Raspberry

TODO

### Other Flavors

Add **essential oils** (e.g., citrus, mint, almond) to the ganache when the chocolate and cream are mixed and still hot. Typically you'll want on the order of 10 drops, but taste as you go and use less or more as desired.

**Flavor the cream** (e.g., with tea or herbs) as outlined for [espresso](#Espresso) ganache.
