## Description

Jonathan's iconic recipe makes what is in my mind the quintessential birthday cake. No fancy frosting or toppings needed, just perhaps some whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. 

## Ingredients

- 2 cups **flour**
- 1 tsp **baking soda**
- a pinch of **salt**
- 1 1/2 cup strong **coffee**
- 1/2 cup **bourbon** or other whiskey
- 5 oz **unsweetened chocolate**
- 1 cup **butter**
- 2 cups **sugar**
- 2 **eggs**
- 1 tsp **vanilla**
- **cocoa powder** for dusting

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees.
2. Sift together into a bowl: flour, baking soda, salt.
3. Heat coffee & bourbon for 5 minutes in a double boiler set over simmering water.
4. Cut the chocolate and butter into pieces and add them to the double boiler, stirring until both are melted and the mixture is smooth.
5. Remove the pan from the heat and add the sugar.
6. Let the mixture cool for 3 minutes and transfer it to the bowl of an electric mixer. (If you don't have one, a mixing bowl and a beater will suffice.)
7. Add the flour mixture to the chocolate mixture 1/2 cup at a time, beating at medium speed. Continue to beat for 1 minute after the ingredients are fully mixed.
8. In a separate bowl, lightly beat the eggs with the vanilla. Add this to the batter and beat until smooth.
9. Liberally butter a 9-inch bundt pan, 3 1/2 inches deep and then dust it with cocoa. Use *lots* of butter and cocoa here so it doesn't stick! Pour the batter into the pan.
10. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean. Err on the shorter side.
11. Let cake cool completely before turning it out onto a serving plate.


## Variations

### Dairy-Free

Replace the butter with a [vegan substitute](../README.md#Butter) that is solid at room temperature. This isn't quite as tasty as the dairy version, but it's still damn good.

### Toppings

Jonathan recommends whipped cream sweetened and flavored with creme de cacao--mmm!
