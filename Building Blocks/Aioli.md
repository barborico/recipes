# Aioli

**Vegetarian**  
**Servings:** variable  
**Time:** 10 minutes

## Description

This condiment has become a staple in our household, spooned generously onto roasted veggies, sandwiches, and other savory dishes.

One excellent use is in what has become our classic vegetarian burger:
- a slice of whatever crusty bread is handy
- a generous layer of aioli
- some kimchi
- optionally, arugula or lettuce
- a Beyond Meat patty

## Ingredients

- **mayonnaise**
- **garlic**, pressed
- **lemon juice**
- (optional) **black pepper**
- (optional) **olive oil**

## Instructions

1. Mix garlic, lemon juice, and (optionally) black pepper into the mayonnaise to taste. I like to go heavy on the garlic so that the aioli has a real bite.
1. If desired, add olive oil to thin the texture.

## Variations

### Vegan

Use [eggless mayo](../README.md#Mayonnaise).
